i updated my website! last time i did was in [2023](https://tiffanywang-4w3l9uyno-cnnmon.vercel.app/). this was the vibe i conjured in figma, using a blender model i made for a 3d class i took in 2024 (after retexturing the hair to match my new hair color):

some ideas i might make at some point:

**stuffed animal role-play**:
- i saw this cool exhibit for this architect sou fujimoto in roppongi where they [made a bunch of his buildings into stuffed animals and made them talk to each other](TODO)
- the convo was pre-recorded but it could be cool (or freaky?) if it was interactive and voice-responsive
- is this an ai friend idea?

**monkey's paw**:
- tool (coding? writing) that is silly and destructive and bad
- sometimes unintended things happen when you ask for something else
- is there an element of surprise necessary to creativity?

**emotional fighting game:**
- web game where you can ~~win~~ ~~lose~~ endure conflicts with an artificial [friend, parent, partner]
- conflict is a 2-player puzzle and every conflict has a unique solution
- each level poses a new opponent with unique needs and vulnerabilities
- emotions are a core mechanic: your opponent's words trigger emotional states which can dampen your communication
- intentionally adversarial ai can help us reflect on how we personally approach conflict

**wishing well:**
- braindump about the person you want to be
- llm will break it down into an actionable todo list
- you can also edit it, add ideas, links, things to read
- every day, you'll be given something new to learn from your pool of stuff
- llm will update your list based on what you've done and maybe add more stuff
- could feed into a chrome extension to make intentionally personalized feeds (filter by "the person i want to become")

**llm arena for overlooked traits:**
- mbti, enneagram, battle taxonomy, favorite other llm, ability to deceive ([botc](TODO)-bench)
