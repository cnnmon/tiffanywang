i redesigned my website! see: [2023](https://tiffanywang-4w3l9uyno-cnnmon.vercel.app/) and [2022](https://tiffanywang-nddwqs5e6-cnnmon.vercel.app)

# design

redesigning a website is a vulnerable experience. do i try a new aesthetic? optimize for fast loading times? this time, i dug up this old blender model i made of myself, retextured the hair to my new seasonal color(s), and placed her as the centerpiece of my landing page. this was the first design of that. you can spin her:

i stole the pretty font (neue montreal) from [this cool website](https://abrandenberger.github.io/#colophon) and coded the site in nextjs and tailwind on the flight from sf -> denver -> tennessee.

well, if you've found your way here, it seems like you've found my new secret(?) blog where i will experiment with writing. welcome!!

# ideas from october

i might act on these ideas when i have the time, but i think it'd be cool if there were more of these things in general - let me know if any of these ideas are particularly inspiring to you!

**personal context on technical docs**: imagine a github repo with a shoutout to the friend who mentioned something off-handedly that inspired it, or a paper with a footnote on the author's personal, unavoidable biases.

**physical bodies of virtual experiences**: i went to this gorgeous exhibit in tokyo recently on architect sou fujimoto. my favorite part was tucked in the back: someone decided to make his buildings into stuffed animals and have them talk to each other.

**monkey's paw**: unintended things happen when you ask things of it.

**emotional fighting game:** game where you can ~~win~~ resolve conflicts with an artificial [friend, parent, partner]. conflict is a 2-player puzzle, and new opponents pose new solutions. emotions are a core mechanic, dampening communication from both sides.

**wishing well:** braindump about the person you want to be, and create a [living design doc](TODO) to help you achieve those goals. you may ask for a new thing to learn, and the llm will update and add to the list based on your completion. evolving knowledge of "person you want to be" is powerful; you could use this to filter feeds based on your stated preferences (e.g. i want to stop watching so many south park clips on youtube shorts).

**llm arena for overlooked traits:** mbti, enneagram, bartle taxonomy, favorite thing about itself, favorite other llm, least favorite other llm, best financial advice (disclaimer: don't use it for financial advice), ability to deceive.
