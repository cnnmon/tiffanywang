i redesigned my website! if you've found your way here, it seems like you've found my new secret(?) blog where i will experiment with writing. welcome!!

### the design

redesigning a website is a vulnerable experience. every time, i flirt with the idea of making a hyper-optimized, minimalistic, professional-looking website, and lose my way [again](https://tiffanywang-4w3l9uyno-cnnmon.vercel.app/) and [again](https://tiffanywang-nddwqs5e6-cnnmon.vercel.app) and [again](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cjlGzkEwjKlM0HqieyNCmgYJnHS1sYuu/view?usp=sharing). this time, i was lured in by the idea of making a pseudo-3d centerpiece, so i dug up a blender model i made for a class last year, retextured the hair to my new seasonal color(s), exported her spinning as an mp4, and vibe coded a way to reactively "spin" her with your mouse (really, scrubbing the video).

my first design of that:

i stole the pretty font (neue montreal) from [this cool website](https://abrandenberger.github.io/#colophon) and coded the site in nextjs and tailwind on the flight from sf -> denver -> tennessee.

### ideas from october

i might act on these ideas when i have the time, but i think it'd be cool if there were more of these things in general - let me know if any of these ideas are particularly inspiring to you!

**personal context on technical docs**: imagine a github repo with a shoutout to the friend who mentioned something off-handedly that inspired it, or a paper with a footnote on the author's personal, unavoidable biases.

**physical bodies of virtual experiences**: i went to this gorgeous exhibit in tokyo recently on architect sou fujimoto. my favorite part was tucked in the back: someone decided to make his buildings into stuffed animals and have them talk to each other.

**monkey's paw**: unintended things happen when you ask things of it.

**emotional fighting game:** game where you can ~~win~~ resolve conflicts with an artificial [friend, parent, partner]. conflict is a 2-player puzzle, and new opponents pose new solutions. emotions are a core mechanic, dampening communication from both sides.

**wishing well:** braindump about the person you want to be, and create a [living design doc](https://github.com/cnnmon/dango) to help you achieve those goals. you may ask for a new thing to learn, and the llm will update and add to the list based on your completion. evolving knowledge of "person you want to be" is powerful; you could use this to filter feeds based on your stated preferences (e.g. i want to stop watching so many south park clips on youtube shorts).

**llm arena for overlooked traits:** mbti, enneagram, bartle taxonomy, favorite thing about itself, favorite other llm, least favorite other llm, best financial advice (disclaimer: don't use it for financial advice), ability to deceive.
