i redesigned my website! if you've found your way here, it seems like you've found my new secret(?) blog where i will experiment with writing. welcome!!

### the design

redesigning a website is a vulnerable experience. every time, i flirt with the idea of making a hyper-optimized, minimalistic, professional-looking website, and lose my way [again](https://tiffanywang-4w3l9uyno-cnnmon.vercel.app/) and [again](https://tiffanywang-nddwqs5e6-cnnmon.vercel.app) and [again](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cjlGzkEwjKlM0HqieyNCmgYJnHS1sYuu/view?usp=sharing). this time, i was lured in by the idea of making a pseudo-3d centerpiece, so i dug up a blender model i made for a class last year, retextured the hair to my new seasonal color(s), exported her spinning as an mp4, and vibe coded a way to reactively "spin" her with your mouse (really, scrubbing the video).

my first figma mock:

i stole the pretty font (neue montreal) from [this cool website](https://abrandenberger.github.io/#colophon) and coded the site in nextjs and tailwind on the flight from sf → denver → tennessee.

### ideas from october

generally fun ideas that i'd like to see in the wild, or i'll make myself at some point.

**personal context**: a github repo with a shoutout to the friend who off-handedly inspired it, or a paper with a footnote acknowledging the author's unavoidable biases. technical work that doesn't pretend to be objective or context-free. (update: [for example](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5EmBW2aAAAvYGQ?format=jpg&name=4096x4096))

**stuffed embodiment**: i went to this gorgeous exhibit recently on architect sou fujimoto. my favorite part was tucked in the back: as what seemed to be an educational experiment, someone decided to transform his buildings into stuffed animals and make them chat with each other. the toys rustled whenever they talked. it was so charming...

**a monkey's paw**: unintended things happen when you ask things of it.

**emotional fighting game:** game where you can ~~win~~ resolve conflicts with an artificial [friend, parent, partner]. conflict is a 2-player puzzle, and new opponents pose new solutions. emotions are a core mechanic, dampening communication from both sides.

**wishing well:** braindump who you want to be and get a [living design doc](https://github.com/cnnmon/dango) that evolves as you complete goals. it learns your aspirations and filters your browser accordingly (e.g. i want to stop watching so many south park clips on youtube shorts).

**llm arena for overlooked traits:** mbti, enneagram, bartle taxonomy, favorite thing about itself, favorite other llm, least favorite other llm, best financial advice (disclaimer: don't use it for financial advice), ability to deceive.
