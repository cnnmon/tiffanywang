Hi, I'm Tiffany! I'm a research engineer thinking about [AI-supported creative tools](https://mj-storytelling.github.io/) on the Storytelling team at Midjourney. I'm interested in learning from playful, collaborative, even adversarial human-AI interactions. I also love game-making and personality tests. Recent works at: [/projects](/projects).
