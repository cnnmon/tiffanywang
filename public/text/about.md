Hi, I'm Tiffany! I'm a programmer, researcher, and artist. I'm currently thinking about [controllable AI creative tools](https://mj-storytelling.github.io/) on the Storytelling team at Midjourney.

I'm interested in playful, collaborative, even adversarial interactions between man and machine. I also love game-making and personality tests. Recent works at [/projects](/projects).

Previously, I:

- Graduated from Berkeley!
- Built product and infra at [Watershed](https://watershed.com/), [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/), and [Ramp](https://ramp.com/)
- Researched [adversarial robustness in LLMs](https://tensortrust.ai/paper/) at the [CHAI lab](https://humancompatible.ai/)
- Taught [Operating Systems](https://cs162.org/), [Intro to CS](https://cs61a.org/), and [Web Design](https://webdesigndecal.github.io/)
- Illustrated for [Kernel](https://www.kernelmag.io/) and [GAG](https://www.tiktok.com/@gag.magazine/) magazine
- Made games for the [Cleveland](https://cnnmon.itch.io/cardiocasino) [Clinic](https://cnnmon.itch.io/kittyclinic) and a [biofeedback therapy startup](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/akron-canton-news/akron-startups-getting-big-bounce-at-innovation-hub)
- Grew up in a small town [with a big park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brecksville_Reservation) in Ohio
